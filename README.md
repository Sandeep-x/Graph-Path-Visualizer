# Graph Path Visualizer
This website lets you visualize the path between two nodes of a graph through different algorithms(BFS,DFS etc.). It depicts various routes taken through sequence of nodes in a graph using different algorithms.
<br>
## Features
<ul>
  <li>Choosing location for stating and ending node</li>
  <li>Selecting different algorithms to visualize the path</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Breadth First Search (BFS) : BFS traverse all neighbouring nodes of same level first then moves to adjecent neighbouring nodes of next level.</li>
      <li>Depth First Search (DFS) : DFS traverse deep down to a path untill it reaches the destination node or not found any unvisited node, if destination node not found it backtracks to previous node to follow a different path down the nodes.</li>
      <li>Dijkstra : Dijkstra algorithm aims to find the shortest possible path between two nodes.</li>
      <li>A* (A-Star) : It is a modification to Dijkstra algorithm, It Can find the shortest path with less number of nodes visited compared to BFS and dijkstra.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Put obstacle between nodes</li>
 </ul>

 ## Setup
 Clone this repository and extract to a folder. In command line move to the this folder and type <b> npm install </b>, It will install all the required node modules in this specific folderto run your react app.
 <br>
 Then type <b>npm start</b>, This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser
 <br><b>Note :</b> Make sure nodejs is installed in your system before running the commands
